Plugins
=======

A number of plugins ship with the PATHspider distribution. You can find
documentation for them here:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   plugins/ecn
   plugins/dscp
   plugins/tfo

3rd-Party Plugins
-----------------

You will be able to list the 3rd-party plugins installed by running:

.. code-block:: shell

 pathspider --help

There is no need to register 3rd-party plugins with PATHspider before use, they
will be automatically detected once they are installed.
